## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hitesh-bhatnagar/YouTube-Adview-count-.git
cd YouTube-Adview-count-
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have the required libraries installed:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Load the Data

You can load the datasets using pandas:

```python
import pandas as pd

train_data = pd.read_csv('train.csv')
test_data = pd.read_csv('test.csv')
```

### 4. Load the Models

To load the saved models:

```python
import joblib

decision_tree_model = joblib.load('decision_tree.pkl')
linear_regression_model = joblib.load('linear_regression.pkl')
random_forest_model = joblib.load('random_forest.pkl')
svr_model = joblib.load('svr.pkl')
```

### 5. Make Predictions

To make predictions using the models:

```python
predictions = {
    'decision_tree': decision_tree_model.predict(test_data),
    'linear_regression': linear_regression_model.predict(test_data),
    'random_forest': random_forest_model.predict(test_data),
    'svr': svr_model.predict(test_data)
}
```

### 6. Evaluate the Models

Use the test dataset to evaluate the models’ performance:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

for model_name, preds in predictions.items():
    mse = mean_squared_error(test_data['target'], preds)
    print(f'{model_name} Mean Squared Error: {mse}')
```

## Usage

To use the models and datasets:

1. **Load the `train.csv` and `test.csv` datasets.**
2. **Load the pre-trained models from their respective `.pkl` files or the `artificial_neural_network.keras` file.**
3. **Use the models to make predictions and evaluate their performance.**
